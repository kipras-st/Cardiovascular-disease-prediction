# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Overview  
This project explores the prediction of cardiovascular disease using **logistic regression**. The dataset underwent preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to assess its predictive capabilities.  

## Key Steps in This Study  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and correlations.  
- **Modeling**: Implementing a **logistic regression model** for classification.  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics like **F1-score and ROC-AUC**.  

## Potential Improvements  
- Exploring advanced models like **Random Forest or XGBoost**.  
- Enhancing feature selection to improve predictive accuracy.  
- Integrating external health-related datasets for better generalization.
